TGIRest facilitates documentation of a JAX-RS REST API. Eventually it should encourage conformity to the hypermedia constraint (HATEOAS).

The library provides annotations that make it simple to describe your restful resources. By having a means to document resources and methods next to the code you shouldn't have excuses not to. Having the documentation and implementation local to each other makes maintenance a simpler task as well.
