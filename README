TGIRest facilitates documentation of a JAX-RS REST API. Eventually it should encourage conformity to the hypermedia constraint (HATEOAS).

The library provides annotations that make it simple to describe your restful resources. Having a means to document resources and methods in the code means one less excuse for complete and useful documentation. Because the implementation and the meta data are right next to each other maintenance should be easier as well.
