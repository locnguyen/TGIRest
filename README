TGIRest facilitates documentation of a JAX-RS REST API. Eventually it should encourage conformity to the hypermedia constraint (HATEOAS).

The library provides annotations that make it simple to describe your restful resources. Having a means to document resources and methods in the code means one less excuse for complete and useful documentation. Because the implementation and the meta data are right next to each other maintenance should be easier as well.

The number of dependencies have been kept to a minimum so integration with existing an API is easier (hopefully). TGIRest only relies on JSR-311 which provides JAX-RS interfaces and SLF4J for logging. There are other dependencies but those fall under the test scope.
